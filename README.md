## 📊 Business Problem

CrediTrust Financial is a rapidly growing East African FinTech provider offering:
- Credit Cards
- Personal Loans
- Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
- Savings Accounts
- Money Transfers

Each month, thousands of unstructured customer complaints are submitted across multiple channels (app, email, regulatory reports), making it hard for internal teams to extract insights or trends.

---

## 🎯 Objectives & KPIs

### 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- ⏱️ Reduce trend detection time from days to minutes.
- 🧑‍💻 Empower non-technical teams (Support, Compliance) to self-serve insights.
- 📈 Enable proactive product fixes through real-time feedback analysis.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

This project delivers a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:
- ✅ Allows plain-English queries (e.g., _"Why are people unhappy with BNPL?"_)
- ✅ Retrieves relevant complaint narratives using semantic search
- ✅ Synthesizes answers using an LLM with context
- ✅ Supports multi-product and source traceability
- ✅ Offers a Gradio/Streamlit-powered chatbot interface
